            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a mechatronics engineer fascinated by the learning process itself. My passion lies in understanding how the world works, moving between different areas of knowledge and finding the connections between them.</p>
            <p>"What I have learned is that many things are basically the same in different disciplines. So if you work with fashion or design or filmmaking, or even banking, you know, it's basically the same principles that have a different shape, but if you've moved from one to another, then you start to see the pattern. Everything I do is some kind of experiment and I've been surprised many times that if you have the will to try things, chances are that it works."</p>

            <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I believe that the boundaries between disciplines are often artificial. The most innovative solutions come from recognizing patterns across different domains and applying approaches from one field to solve problems in another.</p>
            <p>My background in mechatronics engineering provides me with a unique foundation to explore these connections, as it already sits at the intersection of mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering.</p>
            <p>Through continuous experimentation and a willingness to try new approaches, I've found that seemingly impossible challenges often have solutions waiting to be discovered.</p>
